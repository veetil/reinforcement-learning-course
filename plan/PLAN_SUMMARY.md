# PPO Interactive Learning Platform - Plan Summary

## Executive Overview

We're building an interactive web application to teach the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm through hands-on learning, visualizations, and practical exercises. The platform combines Next.js/React for the frontend with Python/FastAPI for backend RL computations.

## Key Innovation Points

### 1. **Interactive-First Learning**
- Every concept has interactive visualizations using React Flow and Framer Motion
- Students manipulate neural networks, see data flow, and control training in real-time
- Step-through animations for algorithm execution

### 2. **Confusion Detection & Intervention**
- AI-powered system detects when students struggle
- Proactive clarifications and alternative explanations
- Adaptive difficulty based on performance

### 3. **Practical Implementation Focus**
- In-browser code execution with real-time feedback
- Build PPO from scratch with guided exercises
- Debug broken implementations to deepen understanding

### 4. **Gamified Learning Journey**
- Achievement system with meaningful milestones
- Progress visualization and skill trees
- Social features for peer learning

## Course Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Chapters 1-4)
