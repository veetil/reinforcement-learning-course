the “overall execution” picture for VERL’s hybrid‐flow RL system. Here’s what each part represents:

    Driver Process
    This is your main Python process. It issues RPC “calls” into the distributed system (e.g. “run an actor step,” “update the critic,” etc.) and immediately gets back a future—an object that will eventually hold the result once the work finishes.

    WorkerGroup
    For each major RL subtask VERL splits work into its own group of worker processes. In the diagram there are five groups:

        Actor (sampling trajectories with the current policy)

        Critic (evaluating state‐value or Q‐value estimates)

        Rollout (running env simulations to produce fresh data)

        Reference Policy (e.g. an expert or behavioral‐cloning policy used for auxiliary losses)

        Reward Model (a learned reward function when you can’t use a hard‐coded reward)

    Each box (“Worker 0”, “Worker 1”) is an OS process (or container) that can run tasks in parallel within that group.

    Resource Pool
    Behind the scenes each WorkerGroup is pinned to its own set of GPUs (or other accelerators). A “Resource Pool” is simply the cluster of devices (GPU 0+1, GPU 2+3, GPU 4+5) dedicated to one of those groups. When the Driver submits a task to, say, the Actor group, that task is scheduled onto one of the Actor workers and run on one of the GPUs in Resource Pool 0.

Why split it this way?

    Isolation of compute
    Sampling (Rollout/Actor) and heavy network updates (Critic, Reward Model) can have very different resource profiles. By giving each component its own workers and GPUs, you avoid contention and can autoscale them independently.

    Asynchronicity for throughput
    The Driver can fire off all five API calls in parallel; each returns a future. As soon as one finishes, you can immediately “ray.get” it and pipeline its output into the next step, without waiting for the slowest component.

    Modular scaling
    If your rollouts are the bottleneck, you can add more Rollout workers (and another Resource Pool) without touching your Critic or Reward Model cluster.

In short, those boxes show the logical carving-up of an RL training loop into separate, GPU-backed services—Actor, Critic, Rollout, Reference Policy, Reward Model—all orchestrated by a single Driver that glues them together via futures.

Isnt' rollout done for an actor. why are they two
ChatGPT said:

They’re actually doing two very different things, even though both involve your policy network (“the actor”):

    Rollout workers

        These processes interact with the environment to generate data.

        At each step they use the current policy (the actor network) to pick actions, step the simulator or real env, and record the resulting state-action-reward sequences (trajectories).

        Their job is pure data collection—no learning happens here.

    Actor workers

        These processes take the trajectories (from rollouts) and compute the policy gradient (or whatever update rule your algorithm uses) to train the actor network.

        They do forward and backward passes through the network, apply optimizer steps, and push the updated weights back to wherever the rollout workers can fetch them.

Why split them?

    Scale independently: you often need far more rollout CPUs/GPUs than you do for the comparatively cheaper gradient updates—so you can spin up hundreds of simulators but only a handful of trainer nodes.

    Resource isolation: rollouts are I/O-heavy (env steps, frame rendering, etc.); training is compute-heavy (big matrix multiplies, backprop). Keeping them on separate machines (or separate GPU pools) means you don’t have them fighting for the same memory or compute.

    Asynchronicity: rollouts run continuously and stream data into a buffer; actor trainers pull mini-batches from that buffer on their own cadence. That pipeline yields much higher throughput than “generate a batch, then train, then generate again,” etc.

So even though both use “the policy,” one is responsible for collecting experience and the other for learning from it—and you’ll almost always want to be able to scale and schedule them differently.

so if i understand it correctly, let's take PPO training of LLM 

there is a critic. it maintains the value network. 
graph G, states s, actions a
Value of state at time t is the expected reward if following a policy 
V* is optimal value or maximal 
V(s,t) = sum over reward from t+1 to H (horizon ) mult by exp decay gamma. = r(s,a,s',t+1) +  r(s',a,s'',t+2) *gamma etc 

First, several rollouts are done
episodes are stored in memory
initial state -> some action -> new state -> action. states, transitions, rewards all stored

Polcy - essentially pi(a|s,t) . probabities for taknig actions at a state at time t. 
policy coded by neural net. often value and policy coded by same structured neural net with multiple heads
In training loop,
  either a random trial picked or a rollout within plicy is picked
rollout means proceeding according to a policy - random or per the actor 
in llm case, rollout means inferences. running inferences on lots of data. 
actor more l ike training. 

reference - that is the SFT trained llm ( in the case of PPO on llms ) . it is frozen .used to calcualte KL divergence. meaing outputs fo rinput calc, at each word,sum plogp-qlogp where p,q are prob of a token by each - actor and reference
reward model - this again can be anythibng but usually llm since nothing else can match the prowess . so another llm for reward

You’ve got the right idea—PPO on an LLM really does carve the work up into those five pieces—but it helps to think of rollout and actor as two distinct phases of using the same policy network:
1. Rollout ≔ Data Collection

    What it does: Runs the policy “inference-only” (no learning) to produce token sequences and rewards.

    In LLM land: You batch a prompt (state) through the policy LLM to sample next-token(s), feed that back in, sample again, … until you’ve generated a full response. That sequence + the per-token or sequence reward is your trajectory.

    Why separate: You might need thousands of GPU hours worth of sequence generation to fill your replay buffer, so you scale up a large pool of purely “inference” workers.

2. Actor ≔ Policy Update

    What it does: Takes batches of those collected trajectories, computes the PPO surrogate objective (advantage × log π), and back-propagates to update the policy network’s weights.

    In LLM land: You freeze your batch of sampled token sequences, compute log-probs under the current policy, compute advantages (using your stored values), and run gradient steps on the policy head (and shared transformer trunk).

    Why separate: Gradient steps are much heavier (matrix multiplies + backprop) but require far fewer GPUs; by isolating them, you avoid stalling your rollout generators.

And the other three…

    Critic

        Learns the value function Vϕ(s)Vϕ​(s) by regressing on empirical returns from the rollouts.

        Used to compute the advantage A^=R−Vϕ(s)A^=R−Vϕ​(s) that the actor needs.

    Reference Policy

        A frozen copy of your original policy (often the SFT-finetuned LLM).

        Provides the “old” log π in the PPO KL-penalty or clipped objective:
        KL[πref(⋅∣s) ∣∣ πnew(⋅∣s)]
        KL[πref​(⋅∣s)∣∣πnew​(⋅∣s)]

        This keeps your fine-tuned policy from drifting too far from its “base” behavior.

    Reward Model

        A separate network (often another LLM head) that scores generated text when you don’t have a ground-truth reward.

        It’s queried during rollouts to produce per-step or per-sequence rewards.

Why the 2× split (Rollout vs. Actor)?

    Throughput → Rollouts: You want massive parallel inference to collect lots of data quickly.

    Compute → Actor: You need fewer, beefier GPUs for the heavy backprop updates.

By decoupling them, you can autoscale each independently—spin up 100 “rollout” GPUs to fill the buffer while only using 8 “actor” GPUs to train—and pipeline them via futures so that as soon as enough trajectories arrive, your actor immediately starts its next update without waiting for all rollout jobs to finish.

So in your PPO‐LLM setup:

    Rollout workers generate (prompt → tokens → reward) trajectories.

    Rollout dumps those into a buffer.

    Actor workers pull minibatches from that buffer, compute policy gradients (using the critic for advantages and the reference for KL), and update the policy.

    Critic workers update the value network.

    Reward model and reference policy are queried as needed but don’t themselves get updated in the actor loop (the reward model may be trained separately beforehand).

That separation of concerns is exactly why you see “Rollout” and “Actor” drawn as two boxes: same policy network, but two very different workloads.

why compute log-probs. isnt it already computed in rollout. to save memory  ? 

ChatGPT said:

When you do rollouts, you’re sampling under the old policy and you might record the old log-probs if you want to save memory. But in the PPO loss you need two things:

    The “old” log-prob (to form the ratio
    rt=πnew(at∣st)πold(at∣st)rt​=πold​(at​∣st​)πnew​(at​∣st​)​)

    The “new” log-prob (to back-prop through πnewπnew​ when you optimize)

If you only ever store the rollout log-probs, those are your log⁡πold(a∣s)logπold​(a∣s). But you still need to run the current policy network forward on each (st,at)(st​,at​) so you can compute log⁡πnew(at∣st)logπnew​(at​∣st​) with gradient flow.

— Memory vs. compute trade-off:

    You could save both old and new log-probs at rollout time by keeping around two network snapshots, but that eats a ton of GPU RAM (storing activations, copies of the model, etc.).

    It’s much cheaper to store just the states, actions, and rewards, then, during the actor update, re-compute log⁡πlogπ under the current weights to get exactly the quantity you need for gradients.

So yes, rollout may have computed log-probs, but those represent the old policy only. To build your PPO surrogate (and get a proper backward pass), you must run the current policy forward on the rollout data to get fresh log-probs for πnewπnew​.

mini batches are pulled for actor trainig 
each mini batch, actor gets adjusted params - incrementally new policy
after several mini batches - the update is signficant. 
to calcualte gradient after each mini batch, the latest policy is used. that is new. 
while rollouts are frozen during this time. 

next set of mini batches , same story. is that the idea. 
ChatGPT said:

Exactly—that’s the core loop of PPO (and what VERL’s hybrid flow is orchestrating):

    Freeze a batch of rollouts.
    You collect a fixed set of trajectories (states, actions, rewards, old log-probs) under the current policy, then pause “data collection” so you have a clean buffer to train on.

    Mini-batch updates on the policy (“Actor”).
    You split those trajectories into mini-batches. For each mini-batch:

        You load the latest policy parameters,

        Re-compute log πₙₑw(a|s) (and the advantage using your Critic),

        Take a gradient step on the PPO surrogate objective,

        Update the policy weights in place.

    Repeat over several epochs.
    After you’ve run through all mini-batches once, you typically shuffle and run another epoch (more passes over the same data), each time using the currently updated policy for the forward-backward.

    Rollout resumes (or continues asynchronously).
    Once you’ve done your N epochs of updates, you start a new round of data collection under the new policy.

        In a fully synchronous setup you literally stop rollouts until training’s done.

        In an asynchronous pipeline (like in that diagram), rollouts may continue in parallel but will only pull the updated weights at defined sync points (so they sample under a slightly stale snapshot until they refresh).

So yes—mini-batches drive incremental policy updates (each using the latest parameters), and rollouts are “frozen” on a snapshot of the policy until you’ve finished your update epochs.
