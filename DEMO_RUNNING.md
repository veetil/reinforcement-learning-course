# ðŸŽ® PPO Course Demo is Running!

## Access the Demo

The demo server is now running on port **3002**:

### ðŸ‘‰ Open in your browser: http://localhost:3002

## What You'll See

The demo page includes 5 interactive sections:

### 1. Neural Network Visualizer
- **Interactive neurons** - Click on any neuron to see its activation value
- **Animated connections** - Watch the pulsing blue lines showing active data paths
- **Color coding** - Blue (input), Purple (hidden), Green (output)

### 2. PPO Algorithm Stepper  
- **Play button** - Watch automatic progression through PPO steps
- **Manual control** - Click Previous/Next to control pace
- **Progress bar** - Visual indicator of current step
- **Step indicators** - Click any numbered step to jump to it

### 3. Interactive Grid World Game
- **How to play**: Click cells adjacent to the blue Agent (A) to move
- **Goal**: Reach the green Goal (G) 
- **Scoring**: 
  - -1 point per move
  - +5 points for moves closer to goal
  - +100 points for reaching the goal!
- **Challenge**: Can you beat a score of 500?

### 4. Progress Tracking
- Visual progress bars
- Achievement badges (some unlocked, some to earn)
- Gamification preview

### 5. Code Playground Preview
- Syntax-highlighted Python code
- PPO implementation example
- (Full editor coming in next phase)

## Try These Interactions

1. **Grid World Challenge**: Try to reach the goal in the minimum number of moves
2. **Neural Network**: Click different neurons to understand the network structure
3. **PPO Stepper**: Hit "Play" and watch the automatic progression
4. **Manual Steps**: Use the numbered circles to jump between PPO stages

## What This Demonstrates

- âœ… **Interactive-first learning** - Every concept is hands-on
- âœ… **Visual understanding** - Complex ideas made tangible
- âœ… **Gamification** - Learning is engaging and fun
- âœ… **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, build up
- âœ… **Real-time feedback** - Immediate response to actions

## Next Steps

This is just the beginning! The full application includes:
- Complete 14-chapter curriculum
- Real code execution environment
- Live training visualizations
- Collaborative features
- Assessment system
- And much more...
