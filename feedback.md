For images, see the image at path

1. screenshots/1.png
x is not shown
formula of y as function of x and h not shown
the animation only shows one path, which will confuse beginners

2. other interactive demos in http://localhost:3001/chapters/1 do not appear.
Once you fix this, critically think how you can improve these similar to above,but witout my feedback. Use your wisdom, think from a beginner student perspective.
