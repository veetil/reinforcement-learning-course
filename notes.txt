Create an interactive app to learn PPO algorithm to train neural networks

Stack

react flow for graphs
python 
nextjs
- other stacks which will add value.

first, create course material 
- linear flow of concepts, hierarchically organized
- present as chapters
second, 
- in each chapter or section, understand what might be confusing to a reader. you have to think hard on this
- think of ways to eke out the confusion ( a surface level reader may not even be aware of the confusion unless they are forced to think over it. ) this can be asking a trick question , interactively. when stumped, they'll think. and answer. if right, good. else, correct. 
- these are the brain stir sesions they need to transform from passive surface readers who get nothing to active listerners who 'get' what is happening 

third, think of ways to make it illustrateive. do reearch on this. 
what diagrams ? certain libraries such s react-flow help with this
animatd is better. example, walk through a toy case to see how rollout, forward prop, back prop, oplicy update etc woork - with very few nodes. 
user has boxes to fill, it then moves forwared. that away they get the cocneopt. 
samples images attached to show example sof how this is dodne 

Example - 
rlhf.gif file in local dir
frames available as rlhf_001.png, rlhf_002.png etc.

fourth, exams
these are actual exams, some asking them to solve a problem using verl library and prsent code or results 
other sare multi choice or long form questions.
