not clear what is happening here. it falls under markov decision proccess, but the example is confusing. what is the point being taught here. student leaves confused

in rest of the page, there are discussion on epsilon greedy , boltzmann etc with no explanation. one point to note in any chapter is to not leave student confused. if a concept is introduced, give a self-sufficient explanation. 
meaning, the student has to go back with a clear conceptual picture. 
now, not everything needs to be explained and overwhelm, but merely mentioninug technical terms with no explanation leads to confusion. so explain the terms and the concdepts. and why that matters. so it doesnt look like random cconcepts drawn out. 

be careful changing. dont break the frontend
